# Matrix-Calculus-Operations-Calculator

**The project is based on the problem statement :**
1. Create an application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide an 
integrated operations and solutions calculator to solve the questions of students 
relating the field of mathematics with an interactive interface.
2. The project utilises the concepts of matrices and calculus to provide accurate 
results on the operations on the matrices and functions(x,y) given by the user and 
display the results, all integrated in a graphical user interface.
3. The application provides support for 12 Distinct Operations in Matrices and 
Calculus : "Matrix Multiplication", "Matrix Addition", "Determinant", 
"Inverse", "Transpose", "Power of", "Matrix Subtraction", "Differentiation", 
"Integration", "Double Integration", "Multiple Differentiation”, “Roots of 
Polynomial”.
